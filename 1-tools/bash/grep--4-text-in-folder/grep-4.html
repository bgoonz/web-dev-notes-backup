  To search for text in files from the current folder (or directory, to follow
  Linux nomenclature), one can write:
</p>
<p>grep “text" -R . -n –include=*.py</p>
<p>The parameters are as follows:</p>
<p>
  text the actual text to search for -R Recurse to subdirectories . start from
  the current directory –include=<em
    >.py specifies a regular expression that searchable files must match
    (e.g. </em
  >.py) –color makes the output pretty -n shows the lines numbers of the lines
  that matched your search text
