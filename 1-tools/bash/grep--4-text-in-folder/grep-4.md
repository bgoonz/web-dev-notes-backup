To search for text in files from the current folder (or directory, to follow Linux nomenclature), one can write:

grep "text" -R . -n --include=\*.py

The parameters are as follows:

text the actual text to search for
-R Recurse to subdirectories
. start from the current directory
–include=_.py specifies a regular expression that searchable files must match (e.g. _.py)
–color makes the output pretty
-n shows the lines numbers of the lines that matched your search text
