  <li>
    Ever worried about accidentally deleting something and not being able to
    recover it? Here are the ways to replace the native <code>rm</code> with a
    safer version of deleting files via moving it to the <em>Trash bin</em>.

<h2 id="how-to-install">How to install</h2>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Go to http://www.maddogsw.com/cmdutils/, download the zip, and then take
      out only <strong>Recycle.exe</strong>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Download the script <strong>toWinPath</strong> from
      <a
        href="https://github.com/davidhcefx/My-Bash-Scripts/tree/master/Convert%20Cygwin%20Path%20toWinPath"
        >here</a
      >.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make the above two files <em>callable</em> and <em>runnable</em>, namely:
    </p>
    <p>3-1) <code>chmod +x toWinPath</code>.</p>
    <p>
      3-2) Add their paths to the PATH variable. For example, add
      <code>PATH=$PATH:~/bin</code> to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> and put them
      under the ~/bin folder.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now, you can simply run <code>trash</code> to delete files safely, without
      worrying yourself accidentally deleting something. You might also prefer
      adding an alias like: <code>alias rm='trash'</code>.
